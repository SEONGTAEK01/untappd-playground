# untappd-playground
Let's play with untappd API!

## Introduction
This is the first project I'm building with javascript and vue.js.
As a craft-beer big lover, the project would be displaying beer-related data and learning javascript and vue.js for fun based on API provided by untappd :)
Cheers.

## Build Setup
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
